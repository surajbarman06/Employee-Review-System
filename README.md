## Description

The Employee Review System is a full-stack web application that facilitates the management of employee reviews. It empowers the admin to assign review forms to employees and gather feedback on their work performance and behavior within the organization.

### Admin Functionality[^1]

[^1]: #### login as admin by using
                email : admin@gmail.com
              pasword : admin

The admin has special privileges, including:

1. Assigning the role of an admin to any employee.
2. Adding new employees to the system.
3. Assigning review forms to employees.
4. Viewing a list of current employees.

Based on the reviews received, the admin can take appropriate actions regarding employee performance. All reviews given to employees are stored in a database for future reference and analysis.

### Home Page - Admin

The admin's home page provides a user-friendly interface with a navigation bar, allowing easy access to different sections of the application. The home page displays a list of review forms assigned by all admins to employees. On the right side, the admin can see reviews given by employees specifically for them, facilitating review monitoring and feedback management.

### Home Page - Employee

Employees have limited functionality and can only give reviews and view reviews given to them by other employees. The employee home page provides a simple interface for these actions.
